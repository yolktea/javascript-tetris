# Javascript Tetris

The playing field consists of a grid and slowly falling polygons. The goal is to
arrange these polygons in a way that it fills all the squares in the grid.<br> At the start of the game, the
grid is empty. An oddly shaped polygon appears and starts falling, a row at a time. \The player can
choose to rotate it left or right or move it horizontally left or right, a square at a time. When the
polygon reaches the bottom of the grid, it permanently stays put and another polygon appears at
the top and begins its fall.\\
